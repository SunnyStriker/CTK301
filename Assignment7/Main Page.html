  <h2 class=helvetica>Taunt</h2>

  <p class="bold georgia"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dtdYVHqK4Q" target="_blank">Taunt</a> She's always aksing, am I alright? As if auspicious or in my pint. I'll find the answer, or a good night. Thank God that time is short. And yes, you always do that one thing. When you wringkle up your nose bridge. I'm trying to figure out what that meant. I took it as a taunt. Remember way back then in school? Oh did anybody ever say no to you? Oh did anybody ever say no to you? Oh woah. I don't think I have a clue. Cause well, did anybody ever say no to you? Did anybody ever say no to you? You're always trying to leave the table. Phone calls, toilet breaks, unstable. And don't you think that we can all tell, you're insecure. You're insecure. I guess I always do that one thing, when I get too drunk and jump in, to figure out what makes your brain tick. I'm a listener. I'm a listener. Remember way back then in school? Oh did anybody ever say no to you, oh did anybody ever say no to you? Oh woah. I don't think I have a clue. Cause well, did anybody ever say no to you? Oh did anybody ever say no to you? Woo! Cause I don't think so! Cause I don't think so! Forget the number for the cab call. As you're dashing out the front door. Claim to try to dodge the cat call. Thank God that time is short. And yes you always do that one thing, cause when you throw, and drench me under your drink, I try to figure out what that means. I took it as a taunt. </p>

  <p class=georgia> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np_YDbq9iBs" target="_blank"> Concrete</a> Any more words? I think you've spoke enough, cause the pubs are empty, and they're closing up. Well you're spitting spite as fast as siliva, but with the prose of a standard English drunk. She says, I hope the salt water ruins your clothes, and I hope you spend the rest of your life sleeping alone, I hope the problems that make your life harder, sit stubborn in your stomach, like a kidney stone, and yet. All this, over a kiss. You weren't there. Why're you pressed by this? Now it's turning three in the morning, the bouncer has put you on his third warning, but I'm still here, I'm not leaving. You won't get what you need. (all this, over a kiss) You know it's always the same, it's all just a game, if I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete floor. What'd you say to me? (all this over a kiss) Cause I'm not sure. I'm not sure, they'd let you off easily. It's a pissed off march up to bus stop station, with pissed up eyes glossed with early conversations, and the consequence of your desperation is the people on the night bus have to listen to you. And all I'm saying is, (woo) how can you look at yourself in the window pane without wanting to hit yourself? But your fist descends through the condensation. All this over a kiss. You weren't there, why're you pressed by this? Now it's turning three in the morning, the bouncer has put you on his third warning, but I'm still here, I'm not leaving. You won't get what you need. (All this over a kiss) You know it's always the same, it's all just a game. If I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete floor. What'd you say to me? (All this over a kiss) Cause I'm not sure. I'm not sure they'd let you off easily.</p>
